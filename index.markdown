    title: My Story
    headline: Who we are
    body: >- 
      In 1985 I was hired at Stephens Moving & Storage owned by Burt Cipra. My job consisted of pushing a broom in the warehouse. As time went on he taught me sales and operations. From there I worked at other moving companies holding roles as Operations Manager, Sales Manager, General Manager, Vice President, and then President. I'm proud to announce today after 40 years the industry that I am the owner of Cleveland Office Movers LLC. Burt once told me that "in the end it's not what you have done in your life it is who you positively influenced in your life". Burt, you were a positive influence in my life. I hope to be a positive influence in other peoples' lives as you were in mine.
